# CLAUDE.md — NEREIDS Codebase Instructions

## Pre-Commit Checklist (mandatory before every commit)

Always run these two commands and fix all output before committing:

```
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude nereids-python -- -D warnings
```

`cargo fmt --all` must be run (not just `--check`) so that formatting is
actually applied. Never rely on targeted `Edit` patches to keep formatting
correct — rustfmt has its own opinions on argument layout, trailing commas,
and line width that must be respected.

`cargo clippy -- -D warnings` treats every warning as an error, matching CI.
Fix all warnings; do not suppress them with `#[allow(...)]` unless there is a
documented reason in a comment.

## Physics Rules

- **No approximations**: implement exact SAMMY physics. Never introduce ad-hoc
  approximations.
- **Document physics in-code**: reference specific SAMMY source files and
  equation numbers in Rust comments.
- **Validate against SAMMY tests**: use SAMMY's own test cases as ground truth
  for each module.

## Commit Style

- **GPG-signed commits**: always use `git commit -S`. The GPG agent is working.
- **Atomic commits**: commit early and often. Huge monolithic commits make it
  hard to catch off-rail behaviour.
- **No temp file litter**: clean up all one-off scripts immediately.

## Project Layout

- `crates/nereids-core`    — shared types (Isotope, etc.)
- `crates/nereids-endf`    — ENDF/B file parsing and resonance data structures
- `crates/nereids-physics` — cross-section physics (Reich-Moore, SLBW, RML)
- `crates/nereids-fitting` — Levenberg-Marquardt fitting engine
- `crates/nereids-io`      — TIFF I/O, TOF normalisation
- `crates/nereids-pipeline`— spatial mapping pipeline (rayon)
- `crates/nereids-python`  — PyO3 bindings (excluded from `--workspace` clippy/test runs)
- `apps/gui`               — egui desktop application

## Reference Codebases (siblings of this repo)

- `../SAMMY`    — physics reference (resonance formalism, SAMMY source)
- `../PLEIADES` — ORNL data normalisation helpers, ENDF retrieval
- `../trinidi`  — sparsity-handling reference (Purdue/LANL, mostly abandoned)
